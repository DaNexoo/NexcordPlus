## Installation
> If you get a warning that the app cannot be opened, click **"Run Anyways"**.  
> You may need to click **"More info"** to see this option.
>
> This warning is entirely harmless and only appears because the app is not signed.  
> Code signing would cost us [**upwards of 300€/year**](https://shop.certum.eu/data-security/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html).
